CivicPay AI
CivicPay AI is a cloud-based platform that digitizes municipal shop licensing and payments. It streamlines workflows, reduces paperwork, and enables mobile integration for local governments and SMEs.

üìå Inspiration
This project was inspired by the [Masvingo City Council's Shop Licence Application Form (Form S.L.2)](https://masvingocity.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Application-for-issue-of-new-licence.pdf), which outlines a complex, paper-based process for obtaining and managing trade licenses.
